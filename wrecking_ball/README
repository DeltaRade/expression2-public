README

To use this yourself, extract the contents of EZ-INSTALL.zip into the root expression2 folder (garrysmod/data/expression2/) and merge any folders it requests to merge.
Once completed, spawn wrecking_ball_main.txt in the world, hook up a cam controller, and then spawn some wire turrets near the chip.

Cheers.
